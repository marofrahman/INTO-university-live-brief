# INTO University Live Brief Project
#### The goal for this project was to identify and justify a list of the top twenty institutions that INTO University should partner with to increase their reach within the US market. ####

Before constructing a suitable list for potential partners, criteria had to be met to maximise geographical growth and international presence. Institutions had to be located in a state:

* which is proven to be highly attractive to international students
* where INTO does not currently have a university partner (you can find the universities INTO has already partnered with here)
* with a relatively affordable price point for undergraduate study

Based on INTO's preference of receruting international students at scale, KPIs were based on:

1) International Presence (IP)
2) Average Cost of Attendance
3) Median Household Income

*please see the glossary in the [business case](https://github.com/marofrahman/INTO-university-live-brief/files/11599348/INTO-University_Business_Case.pdf) for more details*

Below is a breakdown of the live brief project:

### 1) Preparation

As a part of this project the [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/download-access-database) and [CollegeScorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) databases. This stage involed cleaning and reforming the data to ensure it could be used for proper data analysis before joining relevant tables and sets together using Bigquery. A [final spreadsheet](https://github.com/marofrahman/INTO-university-live-brief/files/11599480/FullUni_Data.csv) was constructed which contained the entire data set condensed into one page.

### 2) Analysis

Test
