# INTO University Live Brief Project
#### The goal for this project was to identify and justify a list of the top twenty institutions that INTO University should partner with to increase their reach within the US market. ####

Before constructing a suitable list for potential partners, some criteria had to be met to maximise geographical growth and international presence. Institutions had to be located in a state:

* which is proven to be highly attractive to international students
* where INTO does not currently have a university partner (you can find the universities INTO has already partnered with here)
* with a relatively affordable price point for undergraduate study
